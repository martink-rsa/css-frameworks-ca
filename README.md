# CSS Frameworks Course Assignment

## Code Haven - Social Media Platform

A social media platform for developers built with Tailwind CSS, focusing on clean design and dark mode support. This was built as part of an assignment.

## Requirements

The requirements of this assignment was to build a social media app using HTML and Tailwind.

The app should have user authentication forms, a social feed with posts and a user profile.

JavaScript implementations were not required, however I have added some basic functionality to darkmode within the app.
